# JFK-bot
## Deprecated
This was (is - if you wanted to get it working) a custom platform I whipped up to use a llama-based LLM and the Discord API to add famous figures like JFK, Walter White, etc. to a Discord server. Worked pretty well, but requried either a hosting solution, or a computer with a relativley good CPU on standby ready to do the computationaly expensive llama inferences.
