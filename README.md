# JFK-bot
## Deprecated
This was (is - if you wanted to get it working) a custom platform I whipped up to use a llama-based LLM and the Discord API to add famous figures like JFK, Walter White, etc. to a Discord server. Worked pretty well, but required either a hosting solution, or a computer with a relativley good CPU on standby ready to do the computationaly expensive llama inferences. 

In the future I may come back to LLM and/or llama based llm inference projects though in a different language. I don't like python so much nowadays. I'd rather use the Go or Rust bindings. Or maybe C. We'll see, or maybe not.
